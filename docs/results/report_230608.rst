Progress
--------

- Blurred activations solved
- No WTA = No Background channel
- Activations are stable

Robustness to Noise in the Input data

It does not work yet, one reason could be that noise activates all channels and therefore has quite a lot of support.
Maybe this could be tackled by using larger filters?



Reconstruction of lines

With one missing pixel, it works to some extent: The line is not recognised as two lines, but the missing activations are not completely restored either.
