More Line Types
===============

So far, only horizontal and vertical lines were used. Now, I added diagonal lines with eithre a slope of 45° or -45°.
However, the code does not run out-of-the-box for these additional line types. The problem is, that the diagonal line
patterns dominate the activations within the hand crafted-filters and the network learns vertical patterns in all
feature channels. After a few epochs, the network converges to weights that are similar for all channels.

Therefore, a new set of filters is developed that is oriented closer towards the processed images.

For horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, these filters leads to exactly one active channel.
